# Database-Simulation
Created as the final project for CS_350 Information and Knowledge Management at SUNY Polytechnic Institute of Technology during the Fall semester of 2023

This project utilizes Java to connect and interact with a MySQL Database. There are 5 roles, each with their own limits on what they can access and change. Users interact with the database using the terminal with easy to use instructions for every action. The terminal will bring up tables with the relevant information, describe changes made by the user, and will write every significant action made by the user into an Audit Trail text file.
